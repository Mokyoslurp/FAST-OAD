In our case, as in a vast majority of models in FAST-OAD plugins, the component is an explicit component. The goal of this component is simply to compute the lift-to-drag ratio in cruise. Since we know how to explicitely link the inputs to the output, this will be an ExplicitComponent. Consequently, we must import the component from OpenMDAO API and then create a new class based on this component.\n",

    "### Defining the inputs/outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the component we must define its inputs and outputs. Contrary to a classic Python function where it is defined in the signature, those definitions are made in a separate class function called `setup`. For each input/output we want to add to our component we must know :\n",
    "* The name of the variable : it is strongly advised to keep the naming consistent and clear since the name will be reused in some other components. Different names will be seen as different value so some changes on the aircraft parameters might not be fully repercuted. For instance two inputs/outputs named aspect_ratio and wing_aspect_ratio will not represent the same quantity in the code even if, in reality they might mean the same thing. For future users of FAST-OAD, a more detailed explanation of the variable names is available [here](https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.1/documentation/custom_modules/add_modules.html?highlight=naming#variable-naming)\n",
    "* The unit of the variable : OpenMDAO supports automatic unit conversion. Depending on the model we want to implement, the units might be in the imperial or metric system while for a component further down in the computation it is the opposite. Of course, the conversion can be done inside the component but OpenMDAO handles it automatically as long as the units are compatible. \n",
    "* The shape of the variable : OpenMDAO can handle variables under the form of an array but the size of said array must be given. Alternatively, the shape_by_conn option can allow us to not fill in that field and let OpenMDAO handle the size on its own based on connected variables and copied shapes (functionnality for more advanced users).\n",
    "* The default value of the variable : If the variable hasn't been computed beforehand, OpenMDAO will give it its value by default. Usually, if the problem is properly set up there is no need to give it something else than a NaN, except for variables which we will loop on to give them an initial estimate (for instance the **MTOW** in our problem, the reason why is further explained in the following remarks).\n",
    "\n",

In FAST-OAD we tend to overwrite the default value for **inputs** with a np.nan so that we can make sure the process purposedly crash when the default value for an input is used. This enables to track if either a previous component that was supposed to compute said input is missing or if we did not fill it properly in the data file.\n",

    "For **outputs** however, a np.nan value should not be used, because OpenMDAO will base its residuals computation on it. If a np.nan value is used on one of the outputs we loop on, OpenMDAO will see a residual equals to np.nan, causing the process to crash. The default value can hower be overwritten by something else, in which case this value will be used as the value in the first iteration. It can also be defined in OpenMDAO once the problem is setup, which is how we will do it here.

An oversimplification of the options would be to see them as \"super-inputs\", which can be called in the setup that usually comes before everything. If for instance we wanted to have the choice to use either cruise conditions or low speed conditions, we could have set a low_speed option depending on which we could have defined the cruise conditions or the low speed conditions as inputs. The definition of the option is done in the `initialize` function of the ExplicitComponent class that we thus have to overwrite, and then we will be able to call it into the `setup`.

    "The results are very close from the previous results but not exactly the same. This is due to the fact that when optimizing \"by hand\" the combination are limited by the number of value that we allowed the **AR** and cruise speed to take. Here, thanks to OpenMDAO's capabilities we can find the optimum solution. Indeed, hadn't we rounded the results, we would have seen that the result procided by OpenMDAO is better by 0.01 kg. The same remark could have been made on the [scipy](03_scipy.ipynb) notebook had we done the exercise of doing a two variables optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in this notebook, OpenMDAO allows for a much simpler definition of an MDA/MDO problem. In essence, the only thing that is needed is to know how to construct the base bricks (components, no matter the type) and how to assemble them (the groups). Once this is done, the setup of the problem is pretty much always the same which simplify things a lot. In addition to that, OpenMDAO automatically handles the data processing, so as long as the names remain coherent, we don't have to worry about the wrong data being passed along. The unit conversion is even carried out spontaneously by OpenMDAO which is one less source of possible error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, the difference in syntax from an MDA to an MDO is very thin and there is no need to change the syntax of the model based on the variables which we want to use as design parameter. For reminder, this was a strong drawback identified in the previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however a couple of improvement that could be implemented to ease the use of OpenMDAO. The main one is user-friendliness. Indeed, from the creation of the problem and the addition of the module to the definition of the problem inputs, everything is done inside the Python file where all the commands are run, which might be a bit off-putting for new user. FAST-OAD, as will be explained in the [next notebook](05_FAST-OAD.ipynb), uses specific files to handle the setup and data initialization of the problem."
