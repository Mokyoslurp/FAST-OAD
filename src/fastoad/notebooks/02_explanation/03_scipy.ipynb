The `fsolve` function will solve the equation f(x)=0 so we will need to change slightly the implementation. We will define the function that computes, for a given **MTOW**, the difference between the updated **MTOW** and the actual **MTOW**, which is similar to how we solve the dichotomy problem from the first notebook, and feed this function to the `fsolve` function.\n",

Their Python implementation though will need to use only a single variable if it is to be used with `minimize`. Consequently, we will need to reformat our functions so that it can take a tuple as input - tuple that will contain the **MTOW** in first position and the aspect ratio in second - and optimize the function using this tuple.\n",
