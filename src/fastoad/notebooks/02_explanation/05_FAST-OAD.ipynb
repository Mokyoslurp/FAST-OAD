    "# The FAST-OAD framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between FAST-OAD and OpenMDAO is that FAST-OAD uses specific files as user interface, the main one being the configuration file. This configuration file enables the user to change the model that are used by simply changing the names called. As a consequence, any change in the configuration file will change the problem that we want OpenMDAO to solve. In order to do so, we simply have to give each module an ID, which will then be used in the configuration file. More information on the configuration file are available in [the custom module tutorial](../01_custom_modules). This creates a intermediate interface which allows the user to not go into the code if he so wishes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user is encouraged to check out the [the custom module tutorial](../01_custom_modules) before finishing this one as both are complementary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that needs to be done is to associate our module to some IDs. Here a choice on the level of details needs to be made. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to register every single block that was coded in order to have more control on what is computed in each run. This would for instance means that we register every single base bricks. The consequence would be that the configuration file will be very long as we would need to add every single ID. \n",
    "It is also possible to only have an ID for the biggest group which would make the configuration file more concise but would leave little to no room for customization of the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FAST-OAD and in this example the choice was made to put the IDs at the discipline level, which means that we have one ID for the geometry, one ID for the aerodynamics, ...We also decided to put an ID at the biggest group level but only for the sake of having the closest problem possible as in the [previous example](04_OpenMDAO.ipynb) to show the direct comparaison of the two method. The basic block will almost all remain the same so we will reuse them directly and just rewrite the discipline block and the UpdateMTOW block. This is done in the [FAST-OAD folder](modules/FAST-OAD). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each newly assigned ID will start with \"tutorial.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The only block we will need to change is the block that creates the design loop. Indeed, FAST-OAD does not yet support the affectation of the default value after the setup (which is how it was done in the [previous example](04_OpenMDAO.ipynb)), so we need to overwrite it inside the module that computes the new **MTOW**. It is important to do it because, if not done, OpenMDAO will start iterating with an MTOW of 1.0 kg (the default value in OpenMDAO) which will create some absurd values in the followings iterations, ultimately causing the process to crash. The new building block is [here](modules/FAST-OAD/performance/sub_components/compute_new_mtow.py), the only change being that when adding the output, we give a default value at 500.0 kg which is what we did in the previous examples.\n",
