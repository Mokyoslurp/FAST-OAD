Installation procedure
######################
**Prerequisite**:FAST-OAD needs at least **Python 3.8.0**.

It is recommended (but not required) to install FAST-OAD in a virtual environment (`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_, `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_...)

Once Python is installed, FAST-OAD can be installed using pip.

    **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do `some settings <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server>`_ for pip to work correctly

You can install the latest version with this command:

.. code:: shell-session

    $ pip install --upgrade fast-oad
